# Freemius Deploy

This GitHub Action deploys your WordPress plugin on Freemius. It uses the [Freemius PHP SDK](https://github.com/Freemius/freemius-php-sdk.git) and uses some functionality of [CodeAtCode/freemius-suite](https://github.com/CodeAtCode/freemius-suite).
It was created as a fork from [buttonizer/freemius-deploy](https://github.com/buttonizer/freemius-deploy) but with some 
updates that clean up the code and allow for more customization.

## Environment variables

Set the following required environment variables in your GitHub repository [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets):

- `DEV_ID`: Your Freemius Developer ID

- `PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Freemius Public Key

- `SECRET_KEY`: Your Freemius Secret Key

- `PLUGIN_SLUG`: Your plugin's slug

- `PLUGIN_ID`: Your plugin's ID

Note: The `PUBLIC_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` are your developer keys from Freemius, not the plugin-specific keys.

These are all found in your Freemius dashboard. You can find your public key, secret key, and your Dev ID under 
the keys section on the bottom of the 'My Profile' page. Your plugin slug and ID can be found on the products' settings 
page or in the SDK integration snippet.

## Action outputs (since v0.1.1)

The action downloads both the **free** and **pro** versions and outputs their filenames as outputs:

- free_version
- pro_version

You can access these by setting an **id** to your workflow step. In a later step reference them like this: 

```
${{ steps.deploy_step_id.outputs.free_version }}
${{ steps.deploy_step_id.outputs.pro_version }}
```

These files can then be uploaded as artifacts or deployed to the WordPress SVN repository using actions like
[10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy).

          VERSION: ${{ inputs.version }}

```

## Notes

- Ensure that your plugin ZIP file is present in the root of your repository before running the action. This can be 
done through steps prior to this one as in the example.

- If the `fail_on_duplicate` input is set to true the action will fail if the version you are trying to upload already
exists on Freemius. Default is `true`. Note that if the value is `true` the value of the `overwrite` input will be ignored.

- If the `overwrite` input is set to true, it will delete the existing version and redeploy it with the provided zip file.
Otherwise, if the version exists already the API will reject the upload, and the action will log this and continue with
updating the status of the deploy (release mode, release limits, etc.). This obviates the need for the previous `version` input
as the Freemius API itself will reject duplicates, removing the need for an extra API call and searching existing versions.

- If an invalid value was passed to the `release_mode` input it will fall back to pending.
- If a number less than 1 or greater than 100 is given for `percentage_limit` the input will be ignored.
- `limit` and `percentage_limit` are **not** mutually inclusive. You can use them both.
- I plan on potentially updating the action to a JS GitHub action in the future. This should have no impact on your workflow files,
just some performance benefits and the like.
- Any feedback and contributions are welcome.
